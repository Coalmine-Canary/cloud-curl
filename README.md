# Cloud Curl

A simple CLI to AWS Opensearch, which will support other managed ElasticSearch implementations (Azure and other platforms) in the future, and potentially other cloud services. 

The program signs requests with AWS credentials before sending, and its initial purpose is to replace solutions like [amazon-elasticsearch-proxy](https://github.com/mikael-lindstrom/amazon-elasticsearch-proxy).
